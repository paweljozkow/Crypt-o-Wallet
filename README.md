# Crypt-o-Wallet

This app is intended to record buy/sell transactions (rate, amount, value).
Then you can retrieve single transaction by Id, all transactions, buy transactions, sell transactions.
You can also retrieve general statistics pertraining to all transactions.

App is written in Java. I used REST with H2 and HATEOAS.
Stats are generated using data (current exchange rate) obtained through external API (from coinmarketcap.com).

Please note that many aspect of this project are simplified and be developed in the future.

Enjoy!
